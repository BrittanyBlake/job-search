<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is based on a catalogue of statistics. While building this project, I wanted to ensure that it had a real world application that relevant to the lives of many people, so I decided to build a job search webpage. The catalogue of jobs comprises of a list of the jobs returned by the [GitHub Jobs API](https://jobs.github.com/api) and a search option to filter the jobs by description or location. My webpage consists of two pages using a unique route within a Single Web Application. The first page is the list of jobs and the second page show the information about the specific job. All of the data is from the [GitHub Jobs API](https://jobs.github.com/api) and is retrieved through the redux store.
